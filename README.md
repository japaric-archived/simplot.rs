# simplot.rs

Minimal (2D only) plotting library that calls the `gnuplot` binary to do the
actual plotting.

This is meant to be used by the
[`criterion.rs`](https://github.com/japaric/criterion.rs) project. If you want
more plotting features, go check
[RustGnuplot](https://github.com/SiegeLord/RustGnuplot) instead.
